# HideRedWindowSkype

**Requires .NET Framework 4.5.2**

While screen sharing in Skypeâ„¢ there is a red border, you can use this tool to toggle it.
This sometimes can cause rendering issues and in some applications in fullscreen the mouse can click this border and unfocus our program.

Note:
If you are still screen sharing and you close the tool with it toggled to hide the border, it will still be hidden until you screen share again.
